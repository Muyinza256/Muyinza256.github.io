1. What is the main value of Java Server Pages?
To separate display from processing

2. How are JSP pages related to servlets?
They have the same lifecycle as a servlet with an additional step of compiling to become a servlet.

3. How are JSP pages related to HTML?
A jsp page has the ability to have HTML elements without having to use a java printer. A jsp page can have both HTML elements and jsp tags for java code


4. Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet .
<% double num = Math.random(); %>
public void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)throws java.io.IOException, ServletException 
{
	double num = Math.random();
}


5. Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
<%! int count = 0; %>
public void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)throws java.io.IOException, ServletException 
{
	int count = 0;
}


6. Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
<%-- jsp comment --%>
public void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)throws java.io.IOException, ServletException 
{
	//jsp comment
}

7. Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
<%= count++ %>
public void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)throws java.io.IOException, ServletException 
{
	out.println(count++);
}

8. Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
<%@page import="java.util.*" %>
import java.util.*;

9. Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.
The code in an EL expression is evaluated as follows:
check the page scope for an attribute named "something"
check the request scope for an attribute named "something"
check the session scope for an attribute named "something"
check the application scope for an attribute named "something"
After the variable is found, it is written out to the HTML page at that exact location.

10. Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.
Servlet attributes can be accessed in EL expressions depending on which ever scope they were written. The container checks in the following scopes
Page,request,session and application.

11. Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact.
Servlets can use the request dispatcher to forward requests to jsps. When a servlet calls the dispatch method, the servlet container calls the service method of the jsp page with the request and response objects from the servlet.
