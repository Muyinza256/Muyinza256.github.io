1. Rewrite the JSP page in the first demo (forEach) to use scripting instead of the JSTL forEach.
2. How do custom tags relate to JSTL?
JSTL uses the custom tag api to use user/developer defined tags in a JSP page. Through component development custom actions and functionality is packaged and
reused by content developers. The container reads the tag library descriptor which has details of the tag like its name, attributes and location of the implementing class.
And the tag handler class has the functionality for the tag. The tag can then be declared in a jsp and used accordingly.

3. What is the role of the URI in the TLD and the taglib directive?
The uri points to the location of the tag library descriptor which stores important information about the tag like its name, attributes and implementation class

4. What is a tag handler class?
This is a class that has the implementation/functionality of the tag.

5. What is the role of attribute setters in a tag handler class?
They define special charateristics that the tag may need to perform its actions like color, font style

6. What is the role of the doTag() method in a tag handler class?
This is the method that stores the core functionality of the tag and is called when a tag is executed in the jsp.

7. What does the operation getJspContext().getOut().write(“Hi Bob”) do when called in a doTag() method?
It will print out Hi Bob in the HTML page.

8. What does the operation getJspBody().invoke(null) do when called in a doTag() method?
The resulting output of the JSP content in the body of the tag is passed onto the html page as is without any processing.
