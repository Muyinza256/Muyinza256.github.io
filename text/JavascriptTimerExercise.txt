1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
the first one will take the function as input but the second one will take the returned value from booyah()

2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
var myfunc = function(a, x) {
return a * x;
};
var x = myfunc(2, 3);
var y = myfunc;
alert(x);
alert(y(2,3));
They will both display 6

3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

function booyah1(){
	alert("BOOYAH!");
}
function booyah2(){
	return booyah1;
}
