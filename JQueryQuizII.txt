1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent? Explain why they are different, if they are. 
Explain why they can have different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.
They are all equivalent because fragment 1 takes two arguments (idx and e) which represent the index of the element and the element its self.
It then uses the element argument to change the css of that element.
The second and third fragment achieves the same effect because it uses this to point to the specific element

2. Write a jQuery expression to find all divs on a page that include an unordered list in them, and make their text color be blue.
$("div").find("ul").css("color:blue");

3. Write jQuery code to append the following div element (and all of its contents) dynamically to the body element.
var currHtml = $("body").html();
currHtml = currHtml + "";
$("body").html(currHtml + "<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>");
