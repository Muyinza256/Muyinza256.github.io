9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
 Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.
function Employee(name,salary,position)
{
	this.name = name;

			if(num1 >= num2 && num1 >= num3)	
			{
				return num1;
			}
			else if(num2 >= num1 && num3 >= num2)
			{
				return num2;
			}
			else
			{
				return num3;
